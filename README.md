# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  

# About me
I'm a second-year Master's student pursuing a degree in Public Policy and Management with a specialized focus on Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. My academic journey has led me to explore the fascinating intersection of Social Policy and Data Analytics, where I strive to make data-driven decisions that create meaningful societal impact.

During the summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work at UPMC in their Marketing Intelligence and Brand department as an analyst. This experience allowed me to apply my skills in data analysis & visualization and contribute to the strategic marketing efforts of a prominent healthcare institution.

Before embarking on my graduate studies, I gained valuable experience as a member of the Product team at a startup. In this role, I contributed to innovative solutions that harnessed Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to enhance agricultural yields in Pakistan. This experience ignited my passion for leveraging technology and data to address real-world challenges.

I have interests outside of my academic and professional endeavors, such as the arts and the outdoors. When I'm not deep in data and policy research, you may find me painting, dancing, or going on hikes to explore nature and express my creativity. The picture below shows my love for both physical and intellectual exploration during a recent hike to Mount Tammany.

I've taken classes in product management and machine learning to further diversify my skill set. My expertise and knowledge have been able to grow as a result of these experiences, giving me the tools I need to successfully address the complex issues that arise when policy, data, and technology come together.



# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn to use different tools like GitHub, Tableau, and Python to create meaningful visualizations, especially after my internship where explaining the story through data was the main component. 

I also aim to build a working portfolio with an impactful final project that will help me in my future job applications through this course. 

To summarise I aim to build and achieve:
1. Using different tools for meaningful visualizations
2. Portfolio
3. Impactful final project

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
