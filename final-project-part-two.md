# Wireframes / Storyboard

Using my initial sketches and incorporating some of the feedback that I got from class, I made a structure in Shorthand. It has sections that identify different parts of the problem. For now, I have added placeholder visuals that give some idea of what my final visuals will look like. These are there to give an idea to the audience so that I could get detailed feedback and see if the direction I am headed in is right or not.

# Story
The aim of this project is to compare and improve the experience of 16-year-old girls in three countries, the US, Pakistan, and Norway. These countries were chosen on the basis of how different the life trajectories of girls can be on the basis of cultural differences. The opportunities in terms of education and employment are different across these three countries as well as the amount of crimes that affect these girls at this age in the three countries. 
I aim to analyze these differences and offer policy recommendations to all three to try to improve the experience of 16-year-olds so that they can grow up safe and grow-up to become even more valuable members of society.

## In-Class Critique and Redefining the Project Scope
When I shared my idea in class with my peers, the problem got more refined. I got questions like why did I choose, 16-year-old girls and why did I choose these three countries. While explaining and looking for answers to these, I realized that the problem is too wide to solve and the data collection also became complicated. That's when I decided to narrow down the scope of the problem to focus only on Pakistan. This is because of the severity of the problem in the country. When looking at the data just for Pakistan, I saw that the data was not very defined for 16-year-olds or age-wise. Also, the data that was available had different age ranges for children, some defined them from 10-18 some from 10-17, etc. Thus, I then decided to broaden the scope in this dimension to work on adolescent girls, the definition of which is any children ranging from 10-18 years old in this context. 

After redefining the scope of the problem, the direction became to improve the lives of adolescent girls in Pakistan. These dimensions on which their lives can be improved are in terms of reducing the crimes against them so that the mental health impact can be reduced. Because of the immense amount of violence against them that leads to mental health problems, these girls lose self-confidence, and that affects their economic contribution as well. 

After redefining the problem, I built the narrative on Shorthand and showed that to my target audience and got feedback on that. 

## Target audience

I identified a problem that exists in the world, the problem is improving the lives of adolescent girls in Pakistan. For this, my target audience is anyone who can contribute to the community and this problem in general.
> The target is anyone from the international community who can make an impact. The recommendations are also tailored towards:
> 1. Individuals
> 2. Community
> 3. Governmental Organizations
>
>For this problem set then specifically I chose students from Public Policy backgrounds who have previously worked in the government to give insights on how they think the story can unfold.
> 
## Interview script

> My research stated that adolescence is a very precarious age for children, that is when they are actually growing up and transitioning to become standup citizens of the country. Unfortunately, it is also the age when they are most susceptible to crimes and violence against them. This leads to me defining my goal:
>
> I built a pipeline that will answer this question or at least help us get to the core of this problem. I then shared that pipeline with the intended audience and asked the following questions:
> 
> ### Questions
> 1. What do you think the story is trying to convey?
> 2. How do you think the idea of visualizations is helping in developing the idea further?
> 3. Is the story clear and easy to follow?
> 4. Is it possible to tackle the scope of this problem?
> 5. Any changes you would suggest in this narrative?


## Interview findings

### Persona: Interviewee 1
**Name:** Jane 
**Profession:** Government Policy Worker
**Age:** 32

**Questions and Answers:**
> 1. What do you think the story is trying to convey?
>    I think the story is a compelling one but it has too many pieces to keep track of. 
> 2. How do you think the idea of visualizations is helping in developing the idea further?
>    The visualizations are impactful but can be further built on. Some of them are not that representative. 
> 3. Is the story clear and easy to follow?
>    I think there is a jump from violence to economic impact, a little more work needs to  be done in that regard.
> 4. Is it possible to tackle the scope of this problem?
>    I think the problem in terms of the recommendations that you will present can be tackled very well. However, I am not too sure about the implementation of those policies.
> 5. Any changes you would suggest in this narrative?
>    I think you should build more on establishing the connection between violence, education, and then the economic impact. 


### Persona: Interviewee 2
**Name:** John
**Profession:** Graduate student
**Age:** 28

**Questions and Answers:**
> 1. What do you think the story is trying to convey?
>    I think the story is trying to convey the importance of the situation while providing context. 
> 2. How do you think the idea of visualizations is helping in developing the idea further?
>    The visualizations make the key statistics stand out from the text and allow an easier reading of the data. The maps are
>    very helpful in visualizing the various comparisons being made. 
> 3. Is the story clear and easy to follow?
>    The first half of the story is quite easy to follow but the latter ideas need a better link between them.
> 4. Is it possible to tackle the scope of this problem?
>    Changing the attitudes of an entire society towards women is a very daunting but necessary task. There is someone
>    who will see this work and will learn something new from it. That is enough incentive for this sort of work to be
>    created.
> 5. Any changes you would suggest in this narrative?
>    I would try to include more transition slides or text that help bring the reader along from section to section.

### Persona: Interviewee 3
**Name:** Ryan
**Profession:** Product Manager
**Age:** 27

**Questions and Answers:**
> 1. What do you think the story is trying to convey?
>    The story is trying to convey information on abuse in adolescents, especially in Pakistan. Then it goes on the talk about the longer-term effects of this problem.
> 2. How do you think the idea of visualizations is helping in developing the idea further?
>   The graphs and stats give me a clearer picture of the problems, and also increase my confidence that there is an underlying issue.
> 3. Is the story clear and easy to follow?
>     Yes, I can see the flow that is being made and a data-centric narrative that is being communicated. I can follow along with the narrative.
> 4. Is it possible to tackle the scope of this problem?
>      It is possible to create awareness and make a dent in the problem, it doesn't have to solve the entire problem.
> 5. Any changes you would suggest in this narrative?
>     Talk more about why Pakistan was selected to study deeper into this issue, it would give me more empathy about the situation in Pakistan. Perhaps there are differences in the data that can justify the spotlight on one country

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gaps in the problem description          | I will look for more data to fill these gaps in the story and make it easier to follow |
| Visualizations should be more compelling | The visualizations currently are placeholders that are just trying to convey my message, I will be adding proper visualizations using the same data to make my point more clear                                                                                 |
|   Add transitions                                       |  I will be adding more filler slides and sections to make the story easy to follow                                                                               |

> Personally I think, I need to build a theme, work more on the visuals on flourish and  tableau. I have the data but I need to show it in a better way. Further, I should be addressing the gaps in my research and the problem. For this I have placed placeholder text sections in the Shorthand template so that I can come back to it and work on it further.

I have chosen sobering colors to represent the seriousness of the issue and the images that I will use in the final product. These images have been taken from the free versions from unsplash.
