# Outline
The objective of this project is to do a comprehensive analysis of the experiences of 16-year-old girls across three diverse regions of the world, focusing on the critical dimensions of education, crime, and employment opportunities. Through a meticulous examination of global data sources, the project will identify countries that significantly differ in these dimensions. By comparing and contrasting the experiences of girls in these selected nations, I aim to shed light on the varying challenges and opportunities they encounter.

The analysis encompasses multiple facets, starting with the accessibility and quality of education. I will delve into school enrollment rates, gender disparities in education, and educational infrastructure. Moving on to the safety dimension, scrutinize crime rates, particularly those affecting 16-year-old girls, along with safety perceptions and legal protections. Lastly, it will explore employment opportunities and challenges, including youth unemployment rates, access to decent work, and gender wage gaps.

Through a thorough examination of these dimensions, the project will identify the pros and cons of each country's environment, providing insights into how these factors shape the overall experiences of 16-year-old girls. The project culminates with a set of recommendations aimed at improving the lives of girls in all regions, drawing on best practices observed in the selected countries. Ultimately, this project advocates for global action to ensure a brighter and more equitable future for 16-year-old girls, regardless of their geographical location.


## Initial sketches

The other elements would be analyzed in a similar way. Scores will be assigned to most of the qualitative and quantitative factors and a table comparing all three countries with all the dimensions will be made in the end. 


# The data

The following websites have the CSV files for the data that they have used and I will be using a part of the data from all these sources as part of my story. 

Education Data: https://data.unicef.org/topic/gender/gender-disparities-in-education/

Gender Equality Data: https://data.unicef.org/topic/gender/overview/

Violence Against Women Data:

# Method and medium

I plan on using animation for a 16-year-old girl and her journey in the three countries (these will be selected based on what the data shows as the most interesting countries to look at). Will be taking her through the journey in three different walks of life: 
1. Crime against her
2. Education
3. Employment
For this, I will be using Shorthand primarily to display the story. Will be using Tableau and Python for visualizations.
