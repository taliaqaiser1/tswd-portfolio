# The Bigger the Economy, The Bigger the Debt?

## Part 1: Debt-to-GDP Ratio 2021

Do the bigger economies of the world, reach their level of growth on their own or does debt play a part in it?

"General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits."

We see countries like Japan, Greece, Italy and the US having a greater debt-to-GDP ratio than the OECD average. Many of these countries having a higher debt-to-GDP ratio are among the G7. With Japan having the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021.

## Part 2: Debt-to-GDP ratio 1995-2021

To understand the current patterns of the countries, we need to look into the historical data. We can visualize the debt-to-GDP ratio for most of these countries over time to see if there are any similar patterns we can dive into further.

We see that no shocking patterns pop-up for all these countries. But, seeing Japan with the highest debt and it being among the G7 makes a case to dive deeper into the patterns of these 7 countries.

## Part 3: Debt-to-GDP ratio 1995-2021 of G7

The government debt of the G7 is shown in the next visualization.
Countries:
1. Canada
2. Germany
3. United Kingdom
4. United States
5. Italy
6. Japan
7. France

We can see that over-time the debt-to-GDP ratio for Japan has increased considerably as compared to other countries. We see a sharp rise in debt-to-GDP ratio for all the 7 countries in 2020. We might attribute this to COVID-19 pandemic.

Note: For this visualization, I manipulated the data to only keep the 7 countries and their debt-to-GDP ratio and years. I then pivoted the data to make each country a separate column so that the data is more intuitively visualized in flourish.

Looking specifically at Japan we see it having a higher debt than any of the others over time. "The country's policymakers have grappled with finding effective solutions to spur economic growth. An aging population has strained public finances, requiring increased spending on healthcare, pensions, and social security. These mounting expenses have exacerbated the debt burden."

### Looking Forward

Although all of these G7 countries have proven themselves to have the biggest economies, yet they are not all safe from the shackles of debt.
