# Critique by Design

## Step One: Finding a Visualization
The Cricket World Cup 2023 is going on these days and it made me wonder about the players and the cities they belonged to. There are so many visualizations on predictions of the World Cup and which country has the best players but I wanted to see which city produces the best players and further dive deep into the reason why. 

For this, I searched for an article that compared the cities with the best batting and bowling averages. But the visualizations I found didn't seem very intuitive.

**Visualizations:**

## Step Two: Critique the Visualization

The purpose of visualizations is to compare the cities with the “Best Batting/Bowling’. In this context, the visualization has a lot of text on it which makes it distracting to understand when you first look at it. It is not very intuitive. Secondly, the color scheme has a good contrast but the popping red if looked at for a long time, starts irritating the eyes. Thirdly, the monuments of the cities as their icons give information about the city they are talking about but it also seems like they are comparing the sizes of the monuments according to the data presented but in actuality, they are not doing that, hence, it is a bit misleading. It takes a while to see what is actually happening in the visualization. 

The primary audience for this tool is cricket enthusiasts and spectators who would like an analysis of why would a city win the Cricket World Cup. The visualization grabs the attention of its intended audience through the city monuments as they can easily spot which city the visual is talking about. Apart from that it has the necessary data that is needed to compare them so completeness can be seen. But one thing that isn’t working is how it gives a sense that the size of the icons of monuments may play a part in the visual. 

## Step Three: Wireframe a Solution

I started wireframing the solution with the given data in the visualizations and came up with a dual axis bar chart
