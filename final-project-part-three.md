# The final data story
https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/protecting-the-adolescent-girls-of-pakistan/index.html

# Changes made since Part II
I improved part 3 in the following dimensions:
1. Added the actual visualizations that were missing in part 2
2. Changed the story to make it even more precise than before, and removed the mental health and economic perspectives from it.
3. Added transitionary slides as placeholders from one section to the next for easy transition as that was one of the improvement points my interviewees asked me to incorporate. 

## The audience
The audience remained the same as part 2. The target audience is anyone who can contribute to the community and this problem in general.

The target is anyone from the international community who can make an impact. The recommendations are also tailored towards:

Individuals
Community
Governmental Organizations

## Final design decisions
I had first decided to include geographical maps more but eventually, I realised that Tree maps show my point better. Similarly, I realized that instead of just writing down a few of the stats I could make infographics and I did that using Canva.

# Final thoughts
I enjoyed this whole process a lot. The numerous iterations helped me narrow my focus down. I realized that it was ambitious of me to define the scope as I defined it in the beginning. By the end the scope was such that it is easy to follow and understand.
